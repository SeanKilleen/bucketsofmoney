# bucketsofmoney
 
An experimental repository where I'm tinkering with Marten, TestContainers, etc. to maybe build a little product that I put up online as a way of doing something in the real world.

## What's the general idea?

A way of managaing a virtual savings account across the type of things you might want to have "buckets" for - emergency fund, vacation, holiday gifts, and so on. It allows distributing money into and out of those buckets and setting rules around those buckets to make it easier to save for your goals.
